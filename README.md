# Databricks Specialist Solutions Architect Content Repository

This repository serves as the official storage and distribution platform for Databricks Specialist Solutions Architect (SSA) content. It contains a comprehensive collection of technical resources, engagement materials, and structured content designed to support SSA activities and customer engagements.

## Repository Purpose

This repository provides a centralized location for SSAs to access, share, and collaborate on official content including:

- Technical resources and documentation
- Engagement materials and templates
- Structured offerings and methodologies
- Best practices and reference implementations
- Training materials and knowledge sharing content

Some content in this repository includes structured "Offerings" - proactive, prescriptive engagement catalogs that focus on outcomes and optimize the ASQ process for driving momentum and results. These offerings are designed to:

- Accelerate the adoption of new technologies (e.g., Unity Catalog, GenAI)
- Expedite technical evaluation and competition (e.g., Databricks SQL, GenAI)
- Streamline positioning and hand-off to Professional Services and Partners

These Offerings should include a `catalog-listing.yml` file to promote discoverability with internal tooling.
