  ## Overview
  
  This project demonstrates how to author and deploy detection rules using SQL and Databricks notebooks for Security Detection-as-Code principles. The detection rules use Databricks system tables for real-time security monitoring and automatically create alerts for security incidents. Now enhanced with AI-powered security analysis for intelligent risk assessment and recommendations.
  
  ## Key Features
  
  - **SQL-based Detection Rules**: Leverage enterprise-grade SQL for sophisticated security detection logic
  - **AI-Powered Security Analysis**: Intelligent risk assessment and recommendations using Databricks AI models (Meta Llama 3.3 70B)
  - **Databricks System Tables**: Harness comprehensive operational data from your Databricks environment for deep visibility
  - **Automated Alert Creation**: Streamline security operations with intelligent alert generation and management
  - **Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB)**: Enable seamless deployment across development, testing and production environments
  - **Workflow Orchestration**: Optimize detection rule execution with advanced dependency management and scheduling
  - **Databricks AI/BI Dashboard**: Generate visualizations and interactive reports using Databricks SQL dashboards
  
  ## Security Detections Included
  
  1. **Failed Login Detection**: Monitor and analyze failed authentication attempts with AI-powered risk assessment
  2. **Large Data Export Detection**: Track suspicious data exports with pattern analysis and sensitivity assessment
  3. **Privilege Escalation Detection**: Detect unauthorized privilege changes across multiple vectors:
     - Account admin assignments
     - Workspace ACL changes
     - Sensitive group additions
     - Unity Catalog permission changes
     - Account setting modifications
  
  ## AI-Powered Analysis Capabilities
  
  - **Risk Level Classification**: Automatic HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/CRITICAL risk assessment
  - **Pattern Analysis**: IP-based, user-based, and temporal pattern detection
  - **Actionable Recommendations**: Immediate actions, investigation steps, and long-term controls
  - **Security Posture Summary**: Consolidated view of overall security health
  - **Compliance Reporting**: AI-assisted compliance tracking and reporting
  
  ## Technical Requirements
  
  - Databricks Workspace with Unity Catalog enabled
  - Databricks SQL Warehouse access
  - Access to System Tables (system.access.audit with 365-day retention)
  - Python 3.11+ for development and customization
  - Databricks CLI for deployment
  
  ## Deployment Model
  
  The offering uses Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB) for Infrastructure-as-Code deployment, enabling:
  - Version-controlled security rules
  - Multi-environment deployments (dev/prod)
  - Automated workflow orchestration
  - Configurable alert thresholds and schedules
  - Customizable time intervals for monitoring (24h/7d/30d)
  
  ## Use Cases
  
  - **Security Operations Centers (SOC)**: Real-time threat detection and automated alerting
  - **Compliance Teams**: Continuous monitoring for regulatory compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR)
  - **Platform Teams**: Proactive security monitoring for Databricks environments
  - **Risk Management**: AI-powered risk assessment and prioritization
  - **Incident Response**: Automated detection and investigation guidance
  
  ## Business Value
  
  - Reduce mean time to detection (MTTD) for security incidents
  - Automate security monitoring to reduce manual effort by 80%+
  - Leverage AI for intelligent risk prioritization and reduced false positives
  - Enable Detection-as-Code principles for scalable security operations
  - Improve compliance posture with continuous monitoring and reporting
  - Accelerate incident response with automated investigation guidance
